# Fuel-blend-properties-prediction-challenge
Fuel Blend Properties Prediction Solution - Shell.ai Hackathon 2025

Overview:
This solution predicts 10 blend properties for sustainable aviation fuels using multi-output regression with CatBoost. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering with polynomial interactions, model training, and prediction generation.

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Dataset files: train.csv and test.csv (download from HackerEarth)

Files Included:
- solution.py: Main script for training and generating predictions
- requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies
- submission.csv: Output file (generated by running the script)

How to Run:
1. Place train.csv and test.csv in the same directory as solution.py.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory.
3. Run the script: python solution.py
   - This will load data, preprocess, train the model, generate predictions, and save submission.csv.
4. Check the console for any output, such as average MAPE from validation.

Reproducing Results:
- The script uses a fixed random state (42) for splitting data, ensuring reproducibility.
- For optimization, uncomment sections for hyperparameter tuning (requires Optuna, not included in base requirements).
- Expected output: submission.csv with 500 rows (ID + 10 BlendProperty columns).
- Test on a small validation set to verify MAPE; aim for scores above 76 on the public leaderboard.

Troubleshooting:
- If missing values handling needs adjustment, modify the fillna() method in solution.py.
- Ensure volume fractions sum to 100% in your data; the script assumes this but includes checks.
- For better performance, experiment with ensemble methods or additional features.
